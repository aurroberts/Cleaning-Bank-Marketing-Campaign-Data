# Cleaning-Bank-Marketing-Campaign-Data

I have been asked to work with a bank to clean the data they collected as part of a recent marketing campaign, which aimed to get customers to take out a personal loan. They plan to conduct more marketing campaigns going forward so would like me to ensure it conforms to the specific structure and data types that they specify so that they can then use the cleaned data I provide to set up a PostgreSQL database, which will store this campaign's data and allow data from future campaigns to be easily imported.

Tools Used:
1. Python (Pandas, NumPy)
